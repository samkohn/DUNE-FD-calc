### For the DUNE Fast Monte Carlo

-----------

#### Description

The cross sections used for the Fast Monte Carlo are stored in
a giant XML file used by GENIE. The XML file has splines for a host of
cross sections of all kinds of neutrinos on different targets such as
Ar, H, p, n; for different energies; and in different interaction
regimes (e.g. coherent, DIS, resonant). This spline file is located on
the DUNE computing cluster at FNAL. Some of those cross sections have
been extracted into .csv files. They are contained here.

Currently the files are the total CC and NC cross sections for nu-e on
Ar from 0 to 10 GeV in 40 bins of 250 MeV.
