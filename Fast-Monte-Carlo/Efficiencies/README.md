Signal Efficiencies

### For the DUNE Fast Monte Carlo

#### Description

The reconstruction procedure must determine whether an event is a CC
nu-e interaction (signal) or not (background). This directory contains
various probabilities (as a function of energy) for making the correct
determination.

Currently, there is one .csv file, which gives the probability that a true
signal event is recognized correctly. The binning is from 0 to 10 GeV in
40 bins of 250 MeV.
